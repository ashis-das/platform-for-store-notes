# platform-for-store-notes

********** some major points to be discussed on the above code ***************

•	The necessary libraries, Flask and sqlite3, are imported.
•	A Flask application is created with Flask(__name__).
•	A connection to the SQLite database is established using sqlite3.connect('notes.db'), and a cursor object is created.
•	The notes table is created in the database if it doesn't already exist. The table has columns for id, user-id, note-type, and note-content. This is done using the CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS SQL statement.
•	The /notes API endpoint is defined with the POST method. It expects JSON data with user-id, note-type, and note-content. The data is extracted from the request using request.get_json(). The extracted data is then inserted into the notes table using the INSERT INTO SQL statement.
•	The /notes API endpoint is defined with the GET method. It retrieves all notes from the notes table using the SELECT * FROM notes SQL statement. The fetched notes are converted into a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a note.
•	The /notes/user/<user_id> API endpoint is defined with the GET method. It retrieves notes for a specific user based on the user_id provided in the URL. The user's notes are fetched from the notes table using the SELECT * FROM notes WHERE user_id=? SQL statement. The fetched notes are then converted into a list of dictionaries.
•	The Flask application is run with app.run(debug=True) to start the server.
